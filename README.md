This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# copy the environment variables sample file and fill it with the appropiate values.
$ cp .env.sample .env
# start dev server
$ yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

Project structure mostly repeats [Bulletproof React repo docs](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md). Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks like this:

```bash
src
|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # all the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- pages             # routes configuration
|
+-- styles            # base styles used across the application
|
+-- types             # base types used accross the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```

In order to scale the application in the easiest and most maintainable way, keep most of the code inside the `features` folder, which should contain different feature-based things. Every `feature` folder should contain domain specific code for a given feature. This will allow you to keep functionalities scoped to a feature and not mix its declarations with shared things. This is much easier to maintain than a flat folder structure with many files.

A feature could have the following structure:

```bash
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types for TS specific feature domain
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
|
+-- index.ts    # entry point for the feature, it should serve as the public API of the given feature and exports everything that should be used outside the feature
```

A feature folder could also contain other features (if used only within the parent feature) or be kept separated, it's a matter of preference.

Everything from a feature should be exported from the `index.ts` file which behaves as the public API of the feature.

You should import stuff from other features only by using:

`import { AwesomeComponent } from '@iamai/features/awesome-feature'`

and not

`import { AwesomeComponent } from '@iamai/features/awesome-feature/components/AwesomeComponent'`

This was inspired by how [NX](https://nx.dev/) handles libraries that are isolated but available to be used by the other modules. Think of a feature as a library or a module that is self-contained but can expose different parts to other features via its entry point.

## Contributing / Developing

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the repo:

```bash
# checkout `main`:
$ git checkout main
# get latest changes:
$ git pull
# create a new branch (lets assume you are working on a ticket named IP-1, that itself is a story):
$ git checkout -b feat/IP-1
```

2. Make the changes required in order to meet the assigned task requirements.
3. Commit your changes. This repo is Commitizen friendly, so in order to follow the conventions established you can run the commit script provided:

```bash
# add your changes:
$ git add .
# run commit script:
$ yarn commit
# follow the cli instructions:
? Select the type of change that you're committing: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ feat:     A new feature
  fix:      A bug fix
  docs:     Documentation only changes
  style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  perf:     A code change that improves performance
  test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
